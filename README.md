| Feature                       | Description                                                                                                                                                           | 
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Image-Based Meal Logging**  | Send a picture of your meal to the Telegram bot to begin the logging process.                                                                                         |
| **AI Food Identification**    | Utilizes Google Gemini to identify food items and estimate their weights directly from the image.                                                                     |
| **Enhanced Nutrition Data**   | Queries the USDA's FoodData Central API and refines the results with Gemini to find the most accurate nutritional match.                                                 |
| **Idempotent Processing**     | Ensures each meal is processed exactly once, preventing duplicate entries.                                                                                            |
| **Automated Logging**         | Automatically appends each meal's nutritional information to a specified Google Sheet.                                                                                |
| **Daily Summary Reports**     | A scheduled function runs daily to calculate the total nutrition for the day and sends a report to the user via Telegram.                                               |
| **Serverless Architecture**   | Built on a serverless AWS stack (Lambda, SQS, API Gateway, DynamoDB) for high reliability and scalability.                                                            |
| **Error Handling**            | Employs an SQS Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) to capture and isolate failed messages for debugging, with a CloudWatch Alarm for immediate notification of processing failures. |

## Usage
